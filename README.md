This repository contains used data (namely computed code metrics and tokens) and complete results of the paper "Image-based vulnerability detection under backdoor attack. Lorena González-Manzano and Joaquin Garcia-Alfaro (submitted for evaluation)".

Files are the following:

-There are 3 .xlsx files (resultsGitHubC/ resultsGitHubCSHARP/ resultsGitHubPHP) which contain baseline results of the use of IVul and results per proposed threat model after executed attacks. 

-There are 3 folders (PHP/CSHARP/C_baseline) containing generated images per each programming language used in baseline computations
-There are 3 folders (PHP/CSHARP/C_attacks) containing generated images per each programming language used in attacks computations
-'Code_image_generation_GitHub.py' is the general script used to generate images from code samples.
